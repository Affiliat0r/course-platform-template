## Next Steps for Testing

### Recommended Additions

#### 1. Component Tests (Priority: High)
- Create tests for UI components:
  - `test/components/Button.test.tsx`
  - `test/components/CourseCard.test.tsx`
  - `test/components/Header.test.tsx`
  - `test/components/FilterPanel.test.tsx`

#### 2. Server Action Tests (Priority: High)
- Test authentication actions:
  - `test/actions/auth.test.ts`
- Test enrollment actions:
  - `test/actions/enrollments.test.ts`

#### 3. Integration Tests (Priority: Medium)
- Database integration tests (requires test DB):
  - `test/integration/enrollments.test.ts`
  - `test/integration/courses.test.ts`

#### 4. Payment Flow E2E Tests (Priority: High)
Once Stripe is integrated:
- `e2e/payment.spec.ts`
- Test with Stripe test cards
- Test successful payment
- Test declined payment
- Test webhook handling

#### 5. Admin Dashboard E2E Tests (Priority: Medium)
- `e2e/admin.spec.ts`
- Test course CRUD operations
- Test user management
- Test enrollment management

## Test Coverage Goals

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅
- ✅ 60%+ code coverage for utilities
- ✅ Critical path E2E tests (registration, login)
- ✅ CI/CD integration

### Phase 2 (Next)
- ⏳ Component tests for UI elements
- ⏳ Server action tests
- ⏳ Payment flow E2E tests

### Phase 3 (Future)
- ⏳ Integration tests with test database
- ⏳ Admin dashboard E2E tests
- ⏳ Performance testing
- ⏳ Accessibility testing with axe

---

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests
- Run tests after every code change
- Update snapshots when UI changes intentionally
- Keep test coverage above 60%
- Add tests for new features before implementation (TDD)

### Test Failures
- CI will fail if any tests fail
- Fix failing tests before merging PRs
- Check coverage reports for untested code

### Best Practices
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Write descriptive test names in Dutch when testing Dutch content
- Mock external dependencies (Supabase, Stripe, etc.)
- Use test data factories for consistent test data
- Keep tests isolated and independent
