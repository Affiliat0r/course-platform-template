## 🎯 Payment Flow

Here's how a complete payment transaction works:

```
1. User views course → Clicks "Enroll" or "Book Now"
   ↓
2. Redirected to /checkout?courseId=X&scheduleId=Y&amount=Z
   ↓
3. System verifies user is authenticated (redirects to login if not)
   ↓
4. createPaymentIntent() creates Stripe Payment Intent on server
   ↓
5. Client receives clientSecret and loads Stripe Elements
   ↓
6. User selects payment method (Card or iDEAL)
   ↓
7. User enters payment details and clicks "Pay €X.XX"
   ↓
8. Stripe processes payment securely
   ↓
9. User redirected to /checkout/success
   ↓
10. confirmPayment() verifies payment succeeded
    ↓
11. createEnrollment() adds user to course
    ↓
12. Stripe webhook fires payment_intent.succeeded
    ↓
13. Webhook saves payment to Supabase payments table
    ↓
14. User sees success message and enrollment confirmation
```

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Implemented Security**:
- Secret keys never exposed to client-side code
- Webhook signature verification prevents tampering
- Payment amounts validated server-side
- User authentication required for checkout
- Payment metadata includes verification data
- All sensitive operations in Server Actions

---

## 🌍 Dutch Language Support

All payment-related text fully localized in Dutch:

- ✅ Payment form labels and buttons
- ✅ 50+ error message translations
- ✅ Success and failure messages
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Payment method names (iDEAL, Creditcard, etc.)
- ✅ Dutch bank names for iDEAL

**Key Dutch Phrases**:
- "Betaling" (Payment)
- "Betaal €X.XX" (Pay €X.XX)
- "Betaling gelukt!" (Payment succeeded!)
- "Betaling mislukt" (Payment failed)
- "Je kaart is geweigerd" (Your card was declined)

---

## 💾 Database Integration

Payments automatically saved to Supabase:

**`payments` table fields**:
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `user_id` - References profiles table
- `course_id` - References courses table
- `schedule_id` - References course_schedules table
- `amount` - Decimal amount in EUR
- `currency` - Always 'eur'
- `status` - 'completed', 'failed', or 'refunded'
- `stripe_payment_intent_id` - Unique Stripe identifier
- `payment_method` - 'card' or 'ideal'
- `paid_at` - Timestamp
- `created_at` - Auto timestamp

**Webhook Actions**:
- `payment_intent.succeeded` → Creates payment record, status: completed
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` → Creates payment record, status: failed
- `charge.refunded` → Updates payment status to refunded, cancels enrollment

---

## 🧪 Testing Ready

Test cards available for all scenarios:

**✅ Successful Payments**:
- **Card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future date, any CVC)
- **iDEAL**: Select any test bank → Always succeeds

**❌ Failed Payments**:
