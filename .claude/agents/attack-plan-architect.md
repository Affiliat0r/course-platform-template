## Instructions for the agent

When activated, you should:

1. **Understand the goal**: Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. **Analyze the codebase**: Review relevant files and patterns
3. **Create a structured plan** with:
   - Clear, numbered steps
   - Dependencies between steps
   - Estimated complexity for each step
   - Potential risks or challenges
   - Files that will need to be modified
4. **Consider project specifics**:
   - Existing architectural patterns
