## üîÑ Agent Workflow

### Example: Implementing Authentication

1. **Read the agent**:
   ```
   Open auth-integration-specialist.md
   ```

2. **Follow the approach**:
   - Step 1: Assess current implementation
   - Step 2: Create user context
   - Step 3: Update login page
   - (etc.)

3. **Use provided code patterns**:
   - Copy/paste starter code
   - Adapt to your needs
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Check success criteria**:
   - ‚úÖ Users can register
   - ‚úÖ Users can log in
   - ‚úÖ Session persists
   - (etc.)

5. **Move to next agent**:
   - Once authentication works, move to enrollment
   - Follow the same pattern

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. Follow the Order
The agents are designed to be used in sequence:
1. Auth ‚Üí 2. DB Migration ‚Üí 3. Enrollment ‚Üí 4. Payment ‚Üí 5. Security ‚Üí 6. Email ‚Üí 7. Testing ‚Üí 8. Deployment

Each builds on the previous one.
