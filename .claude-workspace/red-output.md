2. Tell Instance RED: **"Check feature-requirements.md for F001 and write failing tests"**
3. Instance RED will:
   - Read the feature requirements
   - Write comprehensive failing tests
   - Run tests to verify they fail
   - Document specifications
   - Write output here with "RED_COMPLETE" status

4. Then switch to Instance GREEN (Window 2)
