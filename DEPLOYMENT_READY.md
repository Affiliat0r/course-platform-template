**CRITICAL**: Vercel root directory MUST be set to `techtrain-courses`

### External Services Required

1. **Supabase** (Database & Auth)
   - Production project required
   - 7 tables with RLS policies
   - 79 courses + 237 schedules to migrate
   - Auth redirect URLs to configure

2. **Stripe** (Payments)
   - Start with test mode
   - Webhook endpoint required
   - Switch to live mode after testing

3. **Resend** (Email)
   - Domain verification required
   - DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Production API key

4. **Upstash Redis** (Optional - Rate Limiting)
   - Can be added post-launch
   - Not critical for initial deployment

---

## Environment Variables Required

### Critical (Must Have)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[project].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...                    # SENSITIVE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...                       # SENSITIVE (start with test)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...                     # SENSITIVE
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...                               # SENSITIVE
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://techtrain.nl
```

### Optional (Can Add Later)
```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://[redis].upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...                        # SENSITIVE
```

**Security Note**: All variables marked SENSITIVE must be flagged as sensitive in Vercel dashboard.

## Critical Security Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Supabase Service Role Key Exposed

**Issue**: The Supabase service role key was previously exposed in documentation files committed to git.

**Required Action Before Deployment**:
1. ‚úÖ Create NEW production Supabase project (use fresh keys)
2. ‚úÖ DO NOT reuse the exposed service role key
3. ‚úÖ Use the new production key in Vercel environment variables
4. ‚úÖ Rotate existing development keys as well

**Why This Matters**: Service role key bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) and has admin access to the database.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Build process (verified successful)
- Static page generation (25/25 pages)
- Vercel deployment (well-documented)
- SSL/HTTPS (automatic via Vercel)

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- DNS propagation timing (2-48 hours)
- External service configuration (Stripe webhook, Resend DNS)
- First-time authentication testing
- Payment processing (test mode recommended)

### High Risk üî¥
- **Exposed Supabase key** - MUST create new production project
- Database migration (79 courses, 237 schedules) - Use dry-run first
- Stripe live mode - Only enable after thorough testing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Use test mode initially** for Stripe
2. **Create separate test project** for migration dry-run
3. **Monitor closely for 24 hours** after launch
4. **Have rollback plan ready** (Vercel makes this easy)
5. **Test authentication extensively** before announcing
